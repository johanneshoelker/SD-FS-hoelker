SD-FS-hoelker
by Johannes Hölker

Hello and welcome to my Software Development:Full Stack course assignment.
As requested you can find several things in here:
- Exercises_Workspace: this workspace contains all in the course description listed Tutorials except of the Example project
- Project_Workspace: this workspace is only for my own project which I created firstly during the Example Project of Brad Traversy and in the end alone using all my gained knowledge
- coding_diary.pdf: which contains a diary with entries during the whole course work.
- JohannesHölker: file containing my name

For a demonstration of the website running locally, please follow this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/oec6xo9tu05qof9/gardo_demo.mkv?dl=0

In order to run the project on your own, you have to watch the README.md in ./Project_Workspace/gardo/gardoapp
When you have any questions please contact me: johannes.hoelker@uni-kassel.de
